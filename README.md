This project involves the classification of seven different fish species using a YOLOv5 model implemented in PyTorch. The dataset is in YOLO format, which is commonly used for object detection tasks. The model is trained to detect and classify various fish species, leveraging the capabilities of YOLOv5 to accurately localize and classify objects in images. The project demonstrates the application of computer vision techniques in environmental and biological research, specifically focusing on marine life classification.
